              Warangal is recognized as one of the best heritage cities of India. It is 150 km away from the state
              capital Hyderabad. It is also the second largest city in the state of Telangana. The city’s name is
              derived from the Telugu word Orugallu – ‘Oru’ which means one and the word ‘gallu’ meaning stone. The city
              was the capital of the great Kakatiya rulers who reigned between 12th and 14th centuries.

              According to the history of Warangal, the Prola Raja of great Kakatiya dynasty built the beautiful city in
              12th century. The Kakatiyas, who ruled the place for more than 200 years, have left the succeeding
              generations, many grand monuments and architectural wonders like the famous Warangal fort, Swayambhu
              Temple and many other amazing ancient structures. The Warangal Fort, which is the main attraction of the
              city is spread over a radius of 19 kilometers between Warangal and Hanamkonda. The fort was constructed in
              the 13th century in the reign of the Kakateya King Ganapati Deva. The Warangal fort is most famous for its
              graceful and finitely carved arches and pillars. This fort has four large stone gateways.
